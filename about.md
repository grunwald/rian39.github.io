I'm in [Sociology](http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/fass/sociology/) at Lancaster University, UK. I currently co-direct the [Centre for Science Studies](http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/fass/centres/css/) with [Lucy Suchman](http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/sociology/profiles/lucy-suchman). I teach media and cultural studies, science studies and some quantitative methods. My university web profile is [here](http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/sociology/profiles/adrian-mackenzie).

## Research interests
To be honest, I'm not entirely sure what my research is about. I'm fairly certain it concerns science, technology, power and experience. It might be good if it were easily classified as science studies, media studies or sociology of knowledge and technology. My research is concerned with the intersections between power, knowledge, science, technology and everyday life. My work considers how operational, discursive, aesthetic, political and affective dimensions of devices and scientific fields come together. After quite a few years working as a social researcher and theorist of digital technology (working on a range of topics from computational theory, network infrastructures, visualization, interfaces), I have deep ambivalences around the digital. Like many other people, I think it is worth staying with those ambivalences rather expunging them.  I try to do that in various ways. My research draws on backgrounds in European philosophy (social theory, political theory, aesthetic theory, philosophies of history), social and cultural theory (mostly on the Deleuzean side of things, but also paying close attention to recent sociological theory), science and technology studies (very important for empirical emphases), and media and cultural studies (for its insistence on a democratic account of cultural-media environments).
